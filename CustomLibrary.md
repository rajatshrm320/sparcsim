# _Custom Library_ #

SPARCSIM requires manipulating individual bits of the register and memory words exhaustively. Also, as the side effect of certain instructions, ICC bits (i.e. N, Z, V, C) of PSR registers are also affected. Though C is quite flexible regarding providing access to such low-level bits, but handling any data structure having  the width below a single byte is always difficult. Because, mostly application deals with data with granularity of a byte or its multiples. Moreover, latest C99 standard is silentwhen it comes to right shifting a bit vector. Therefore, the right shifting operatorâ€™s behaviour varies across compilers, some of them sign extends the MSB, some do not. Hence, the  simulator relies on its custom
developed bit library to wrap up such operations ina systematic and reliable way.
