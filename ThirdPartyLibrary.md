# _Third - party Library_ #

---


ELF file format is complex by its very nature. Dissecting it programmatically is a lot of effort and a project on its own. To cut down on the development time and to stay focus on the objective, a third-party library, “[LIBELF](http://www.mr511.de/software/english.html) “, has been used. It has been authored by Michael
Riepe and has been released under GNU LGPL, thus causing no licensing issues. As a note, GNU LGPL, though discouraged by “Free Software Foundation”, allows the developers to write commercial products using free library/source code.
